 **Bio-organic geochemistry in estuaries and coasts**
 
- **Carbon cycling in coastal bays**  
By using optical techniques and ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry, we investigated the chemistry of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Chinese coastal bays. We revealed that decreased nutrients likely activate microbial carbon pump in coastal bays. (Zhao et al., 2021, 2023a, 2023b)

- **Photochemical degradation of DOM**  
Dissolved organic matter (DOM) sustains a substantial part of the organic matter transported seaward in large estuaries, where photochemical reactions significantly influence its transformation and fate. Irradiation experiments can provide valuable information on the photochemical reactivity (photo-labile, photo-resistant, and photo-product) of molecules. We revealed that initial compositions of dissolved organic matter determine photochemical transformation. (Zhao et al., 2023c, WR)
