 **Bio-organic geochemistry in estuaries and coasts**

By using optical techniques and ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry, we investigated the chemistry of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Chinese coastal bays. We revealed that decreased nutrients likely activate microbial carbon pump in coastal bays.
